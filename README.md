# News Unchained

News Unchained is a Google Chrome extension that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine levels of sentiment in a body of text. By understanding the levels of sentiment applied in a given text and using knowledge from research, portions of text can be omitted from a web domain activating the elimination of bias. With more objectivity, the reader can formulate opinions for themselves without being chained to subjectivity.
